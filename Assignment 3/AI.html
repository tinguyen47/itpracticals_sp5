                <h3><button type="button">Increased Productivity</button></h3>
                <p>
                    According to Denning (2023), AI-driven automation can handle time-consuming and repetitive activities, allowing staff to concentrate on more strategic and creative elements of their roles. As a result, operational expenses are decreased and operational effectiveness increased.

                <p>
                    A significant number of consumer questions are processed by AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants, which offer prompt answers and free up human customer support agents to handle more complicated problems. Both client satisfaction and service efficiency increase as a result. (Marteking's AI Newsletter, 2023)

                <p>
                    Uzialko (2023) stated that Artificial intelligence makes use of a huge amount of data to identify patterns of individuals' search activity and offer more relevant data based on what they are looking for. Users will get a more personalized experience as they use their devices more frequently and as AI technology advances. Small businesses will benefit greatly from this as it will make it easier to target a very specific audience.

                <h3><button type="button">Marketing</button></h3>
                <p>
                    Of all a company’s functions, marketing has perhaps the most to gain from artificial intelligence. According to a survey conducted in August 2019 by the American Marketing Association, the use of AI has increased by 27% during the past 18 months. Furthermore, three of the top five AI objectives were marketing-focused: improving current products and services, developing new products and services, and strengthening customer relationships, according to a 2020 Deloitte global survey of early adopters of AI.

            <h2>Drawbacks</h2>

            <article>
                <h3><button type="button">Data Privacy and Security Concerns</button></h3>
                <p>
                    The possibility of data breaches and illegal access to personal information is the primary privacy worry associated with AI. Because there is so much data being gathered and processed, there is a chance that it could be exploited through hacking or other security flaws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While AI has the ability to completely transform our way of life, there are also serious privacy concerns presented by this technology. According to Quarks Technosoft CEO Vipin Vindal, "AI has the potential to gather and analyze huge amounts of personal data, which can be used for various purposes, both positive and negative."

                <h3><button type="button">Implementation Costs</button></h3>
                <p>
                    The hardware needed for running AI algorithms is one of the primary contributors to the expenses. Specialized hardware that can manage the large volume of data and computations required is necessary to run AI algorithms effectively. An AI system can be expensive to set up and operate as this hardware is typically more expensive than regular computer hardware. (Reilly, 2023)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The co-CEO of Akkio, an AI platform for real-time decision making, emphasized that although software expenses can be significant, they often get overlooked or underestimated. For instance, the process of identifying data for training can be expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, before being utilized by AI algorithms, data must still be categorized, cleaned, and processed once it has been acquired.

                <h3>Recommendation</h3>
                <p>
                    In order for AI to be fully utilized, Data Security and Quality must be a top priority. It can be done by creating strong data governance mechanisms to guarantee the security, privacy, and quality of the information you provide. Respect the applicable laws in order to preserve client trust and reduce possible risks. Another strategy is to invest in AI education and training. To build an efficient AI working environment, offer training programs that improve the staffs and set up funds for people to learn about AI technology.
